The project started as a Python + Flask app serving static HTML. I started my JavaScript learning by customising Bootstrap components then, as I became comfortable with the syntax, using the DOM for my own components and events. The gap in knowledge and practise between the first and current features soon grew too wide for practical development, making a fresh start of an improved project inevitable.

Now, <i>Persistence</i> is a TypeScript + React project delivered as a Progressive Web App available cross-platform with mobile installation via bookmark. It features an interactive graphical training calendar with extensive planning features, built from all custom components and fully responsive layouts with Sass. The back-end is still Python + Flask, but is now implimented as a REST API featuring token authentication and connection to a relational database. I also separated file parsing into an independent microservice, which features my parsing algorithm and document storage protocol for the sportswatch data that powers the app. Currently the user can create standard dashboard style graphics from their data, but in the future I will be adding analyses with temporal information algorithms I've previously used in research, and more personalised feedback with automated classifiers.
