It's built and bundled with Vite and hosted on Firebase. It features an interactive graphical training calendar with extensive planning features, built from all custom components and fully responsive layouts with Sass. The back-end is still Python + Flask, but is now implimented as a REST API featuring token authentication and connection to a relational database with MySQL. I also separated file parsing into an independent microservice, which features my parsing algorithm and document storage protocol for the sportswatch data that powers the app. ",

There are also wildcards; 8s skip players, 7s reverses value so the lowest card wins, and the joker substitutes as a multiple of another card. And some idiosyncratic features, like the lowest value card being a 3, then up through King, Ace then 2s being the highest. Except for 3-Spades, which is a trump card.
