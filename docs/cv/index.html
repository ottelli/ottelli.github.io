        <p>I thoroughly enjoyed learning to program at university. Unfortunately, we were using MATLAB which is proprietary software, so after graduating I switched to Python. I love the experience of having an idea, building it with code, and seeing it come to life. Code also allows a single person to build scalable products and services, the perfect medium with which to apply my acquired skills.</p>
        
        <p>Sports engineering is the application of maths, physics and computer science to solve sporting problems, and the problems that attract me the most surround measuring real-world performance, and using that data to provide useful feedback to amateurs and professionals alike. My first product to be released will be <a href="https://persistence.rhotech.app/about"><i><b>Persistence</b></i></a>, a training calendar and insights app, delivered as a PWA to be available cross-platform and installable via bookmark. In future, I have plans for both software and hardware products drawing on my research expertise with wearable sensors.</p>

        <p>This course was designed to apply advanced engineering techniques like simulation and computer vision to research and development of sports technologies and equipment. I developed my biomechanical and physiological understanding and gained new technical abilities that give me confidence that I can have a positive impact in any area of human-centred technology and engineering.</p>
        <p>I dedicated my thesis project to testing the hypothesis that non-linearities in gait would predict running economy (energy efficiency). I built upon the wearable sensor techniques from my undergraduate, adding temporal information algorithms like Sample Entropy and Fluctuation Analysis. Combined with gas exchange measurements I was able confirm my hypothesis and demonstrate that a J-shaped curve of efficiency exists in running gait, with faster athletes exhibiting a wider and deeper trough of greater energy efficiency across the velocity scale, predictable from wearable sensor data.</p>
        <ul><b>Key Themes</b>
          <li>Computation; Computer vision, advanced statistics, and modelling physical systems with differential equations.</li>
          <li>Innovation and Enterprise; listening to a problem, designing and testing a solution, then formulating a viable business plan around it.</li>
          <li>Simulation; Mechanical, vibrational, and aerodynamic simulation. </li>
          <li>Research and Testing; Wearable instrumentation, high-speed photography, 2D and 3D photogrammetry.</li>
          <li>Human-Centred Design; Physiology, qualitative methods, human factors and motor learning.</li>
